    his code implements a Heap data structure to find the minimum and maximum marks among a given set of student marks. Here's how it works:

    1. The code defines a class `Heap` to represent the Heap data structure.

    2. The class `Heap` has private member variables `n` (number of students), `minheap` (array for minimum heap), and `maxheap` (array for maximum heap).

    3. The `get()` function is used to get the input from the user. It prompts the user to enter the number of students and then asks for the marks of each student. The marks are stored in both the `minheap` and `maxheap` arrays.

    4. The `upAdjust()` function is used to perform the up-adjustment operation on the heap to maintain the heap property.

    5. In the `upAdjust()` function, if `m` is false, it performs up-adjustment on the `minheap`. It compares the parent node with the current node and swaps them if necessary to maintain the max heap property. The process continues until the current node is in its correct position or until the root node is reached.

    6. If `m` is true, it performs up-adjustment on the `maxheap`. It compares the parent node with the current node and swaps them if necessary to maintain the min heap property. The process continues until the current node is in its correct position or until the root node is reached.

    7. In the `main()` function, an instance of the `Heap` class is created.

    8. The `get()` function is called to get the student marks from the user and build the heaps.

    9. The `displayMin()` function is called to display the maximum marks, which is the root element of the `minheap`.

    10. The `displayMax()` function is called to display the minimum marks, which is the root element of the `maxheap`.

    11. The program ends after displaying the minimum and maximum marks.

    The code demonstrates the use of the Heap data structure to efficiently find the minimum and maximum marks among a set of student marks.*/
